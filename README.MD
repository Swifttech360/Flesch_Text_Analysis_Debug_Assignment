# Flesch_Text_Analysis_Debug_Assignment

Program Name: TextAnalysis.py

Authors:

Description:
    This program allows the user to select a text file (txt, rtf, MD, etc.) by entering its name. The program then 
    displays the number of words, sentences, and syllables found within the file's text. Additionally, this program 
    also uses unique formulas to determine the academic grade and skill level of the text file's author.

Instructions:
    All you have to do to run the program is run "TextAnalysis.py". Once the program has started, enter "y" to any 
    prompts that ask to install packages (this may not occur if you already have them installed), then just 
    enter the name of the file you want the program to read.
    
Sidenote:
    For the program to properly find a text file in your directory, make sure to add the file's extension at the end 
    of it. Additionally, make sure the file is in the same directory as TextAnalysis.py.
